## Key Components

### SVM Classification
The application simulates Support Vector Machine classification to categorize speech patterns:
- **Clear Speech**: High-quality, understandable speech
- **Noisy Environment**: Speech with background interference
- **Emotional Speech**: Speech with emotional undertones
- **Fast/Slow Speech**: Rate-based classification
- **Accented Speech**: Non-native speaker detection

### Attention Mechanism
Advanced attention algorithm that:
- Calculates word importance weights
- Provides visual feedback through color intensity
- Considers context and semantic relationships
- Supports multi-head attention simulation

### Audio Processing
Real-time audio analysis including:
- Volume level monitoring
- Frequency distribution analysis
- Voice activity detection
- Quality assessment and recommendations

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support (recommended)
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Partial support (Web Speech API limitations)
- **Edge**: Full support

**Note**: Web Speech API requires HTTPS in production environments.

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
1. Push your code to a Git repository
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with default settings
4. Ensure HTTPS is enabled for speech recognition

### Environment Setup
No additional environment variables required. The application uses browser APIs exclusively.

## Performance Optimization

- **Efficient State Management**: Optimized React hooks usage
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of audio contexts
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Code Splitting**: Ready for production bundling

## Security Considerations

- **Microphone Permissions**: Proper permission handling
- **Data Privacy**: No speech data sent to external servers
- **Local Processing**: All AI simulations run client-side
